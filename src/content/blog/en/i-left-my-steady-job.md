There are moments in life when you feel it’s time to change course. For years, I worked as an **interior designer**: a secure job, what many would call the classic “steady job.” A career that gave me so much, allowed me to express my creativity, and to design spaces for others. But inside me, a voice kept whispering something different. I no longer wanted to just design the spaces where people live their special moments; I wanted to create those moments, welcome them, and make you feel at home in a whole new way.

## The Roots of the Dream

This “madness” has deep roots, dating back to my childhood in **Ururi**, in the province of Campobasso. It was my parents, with their bar in the heart of Molise, who passed on the passion for this craft to me. Watching them, I learned that the restaurant business is not just about serving food or drinks, but it is an act of welcome and dedication towards others. It is thanks to their example that today I have decided to follow my heart.

That’s how I made the scariest and most exciting decision of my life: I left everything to open a restaurant. My dream found its home in a place I would call magical: **Granaiola (Bagni di Lucca)**, in the beautiful Lima Valley, in Bagni di Lucca. Here, time seems to flow at a different, more human, more authentic pace. The altitude, the crisp air, and the greenery surrounding everything remind me of the mountains—that feeling of peace and breath that we often forget in the daily frenzy.

### A Vision Taking Shape

When I first saw the premises of the former Biribisso restaurant, closed for several years, I knew it was the right place. Of course, there was much to do, but my experience as an interior designer did not go to waste! On the contrary, it was my greatest resource. I personally took care of every detail of the renovation, both inside and out. I wanted the place to reflect my vision: a welcoming environment, curated but not pretentious, where every corner tells a story of passion and rebirth. 

Only the final touches are missing—those small details that make the difference—but the soul of **“La Corte di Laura”** is already there, vibrant and ready to welcome you.

## New Encounters and New Flavors

I am not alone in this adventure. I am pleased to announce that the kitchen is entrusted to the expert hands of our new chef, **Felipe**. With him, we have studied a menu that celebrates the territory but also looks ahead—dishes that taste of tradition and care. Felipe has brought incredible energy to the kitchen, and I can't wait for you to taste his creations. We believe that food is an act of love, and we want every dish served at the Corte to convey just that.

You might wonder: *“But was it worth it? Leaving security for the unknown?”*. The answer is yes. Bagni di Lucca has enormous potential, and I firmly believe in the beauty of this territory. It’s an enchanting, relaxing place, perfect for unplugging.

### The Future Among the Clouds

As for the future, the project doesn't stop at just the restaurant. Above the restaurant, there are rooms we are preparing. They aren’t ready yet—there’s still work to do to make them perfect for your stay—but the goal is to soon offer hospitality as well. Imagine coming here, enjoying an extraordinary dinner prepared by Felipe, and then staying to sleep in the silence of the valley, perhaps after a day of trekking on our trails.

The wait is over. The lights are on, the table is almost set, and the excitement is sky-high. This is not just a restaurant; it’s the realization of a lifelong dream, and I can’t wait to share it with you.

In Granaiola (Bagni di Lucca), everything is ready to toast together to this new beginning. It’s time to discover the magic of the Lima Valley and let yourself be pampered by our cuisine.
