The menu at **La Corte di Laura** is born from a clear and conscious choice: to put the raw materials at the center, respect their seasonality, and enhance them through a cuisine deeply rooted in Italian and Tuscan tradition, yet capable of evolving through a modern and creative lens. It is a story told through authentic flavors, familiar aromas, and surprising details, dish after dish.

## The Soul of the Kitchen: Chef Felipe Cilli

Leading the kitchen is Chef **Felipe Cilli**, Brazilian by birth but Tuscan by adoption, who over the years has built a solid path made of experience, technique, and great passion. His cuisine is the result of a precise balance: respect for the recipes of memory and a constant desire to innovate, without ever distorting the identity of the dishes. Each menu proposal is designed to be recognizable, comforting, and at the same time capable of offering something more.

### Raw Materials and Territory

Raw materials are carefully selected, prioritizing local producers and excellent quality ingredients. Choice meats, artisanal cold cuts and cheeses, seasonal vegetables, local extra virgin oils, and products that change following the natural rhythm of the year. This attention is reflected in a menu that is never static but constantly renewed to always offer the best of what the season has to offer.

## A Journey Through Flavors

*   **Starters**: Open the journey with bold and harmonious flavors, where Tuscan tradition is reinterpreted with lightness and elegance.
*   **First Courses**: Tell the story of the territory through pastas, risottos, and preparations that enhance simple ingredients, transforming them into complete experiences, rich in aromas and textures.
*   **Main Courses**: Designed to satisfy those who love the great classics, such as meats cooked with respect and precision, but also those looking for more contemporary pairings and curated presentations.

> "Nothing is left to chance; everything is guided by the idea of offering an authentic and memorable gastronomic experience."

### Innovation in the Details

Chef Felipe Cilli's innovative touch is recognized in the details: a sauce that enhances without overpowering, a precision-studied cooking, a contrast of textures that makes the dish dynamic. The finale of the menu is also an important moment: desserts close the journey with balance, without excess, combining indulgence and freshness, often inspired by tradition but revisited with modern sensitivity.

Sitting at the table at La Corte di Laura means embarking on a journey through taste, quality, and passion. A menu designed for those who love to eat well, for those who recognize the value of things made with care, and for those seeking a cuisine capable of telling a story—ours.
